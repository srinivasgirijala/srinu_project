    <h5>HISTORY:</h5><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is America’s civil space program and the global leader in space exploration. The agency has a diverse workforce of just under 18,000 civil servants, and works with many more U.S. contractors, academia, and international and commercial partners to explore, discover, and expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity. With an annual budget of $23.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2021, which is less than 0.5% of the overall U.S. federal budget, NASA supports more than 312,000 jobs across the United States, generating more than $64.3 billion in total economic output (Fiscal Year 2019). 

At its 20 centers and facilities across the country – and the only National Laboratory in space – NASA studies Earth, including its climate, our Sun, and our solar system and beyond. We conduct research, testing, and development to advance aeronautics, including electric propulsion and supersonic flight. We develop and fund space technologies that will enable future exploration and benefit life on Earth.

NASA also leads a Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes working with U.S. industry, international partners, and academia to develop new technology, and send science research and soon humans to explore the Moon on Artemis missions that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet. In addition to those major missions, the agency shares what it learns so that its information can make life better for people worldwide. For example, companies use NASA discoveries and technologies to create new products for the public. To ensure future success for the agency and the nation, NASA also supports education efforts in STEM with an emphasis on increasing diversity in our future workforce.</p>

            <h5>EXPLANATION:</h5> <p>NASA is more than astronauts. We are scientists, engineers, IT specialists, human resources specialists, accountants, writers, technicians and many other kinds of people working together to break barriers to achieve the seemingly impossible.
            We continue NASA’s legacy of excellence through an unprecedented array of missions—from laying the foundation to expand our human presence in deep space to developing cutting-edge technologies to studying Earth’s system. We tackle each adventure with curiosity and innovation to leave an enduring impact on the world and humanity.Best known for its achievements in atmospheric flight research and operations, the mission of NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center is to advance science and technology through flight. Armstrong is located in the majestic western Mojave Desert, which is less than 2 hours from the excitement of Los Angeles. For more than 60 years, Armstrong projects have led to major advancements in the design and capabilities of state-of-the-art civilian and military aircraft. The newest, the fastest, the highest—all have made their debut in the vast, clear desert skies over Armstrong. The center’s 560 civil service employees design supersonic jets that push the frontiers of flight overhead, as well as sophisticated remotely piloted aircraft that safely detect forest fire hot spots. Armstrong’s space operations, flight research and scientific discovery projects</p>
            <P>Best known for its leadership in scientific discovery and understanding, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is located between the vibrant cities of Baltimore and Washington, DC. Goddard is the home of innovative Earth science, astrophysics, heliophysics and planetary science, as well as the nation’s largest group of scientists and engineers dedicated to using observations from space to expand knowledge of Earth and our solar system. Goddard’s 3,300 civil service employees range from interns to accomplished Nobel Prize winners, and they work on a variety of exciting projects, including many of NASA’s Earth observation, astronomy and space physics missions. Goddard also serves as a major U.S.</P>

                <h3><center>NASA EXPERIMENTAL FABRICATION BRANCH</center></h3>
            </div>

            <h5>EXPERIMENTS:</h5><P>The Armstrong Experimental Fabrication Branch is a one-stop manufacturing, modification, and repair center. The branch consists of five shops that provide machining, sheet metal, tubing, welding, and composite fabrication for aerospace and ground requirements. A production controller on staff will coordinate the outsourcing to offsite manufacturing facilities if the requirements exceed the capacity or competency of the branch.

    The 20 engineering technicians in the branch are highly skilled fabricators and experienced master craftsmen.  Pro-Engineering software is the primary CNC programming system used in the branch to produce complex or sophisticated parts. The Experimental Fabrication Branch can assist with your project from design phase through assembly and installation.</P>

              <h5>EXPLANATION:</h5>  <p>Rockets play important roles in our daily lives. Everything from cell phone communication to cable television has been simplified due to rockets taking satellites into space. What makes a rocket launch? A rocket works in the same manner as a ballon. Walls compress the air inside. Due to the compression, the air pushes back, balancing the pressure both in and out. Releasing the nozzle allows air to escape, which then propels the ballon forward away from the escaping air. Rockets use gas, either in liquid or solid form, to move forward.
                    Considering the first law, the rocket needs to go from resting at the launch pad to moving. Even though the rockets remains in a resting state unseen forces work against it. The force of gravity pulls the rocket downward while the surface of the launchpad work at pushing it up. The rocket remains balanced. Once the engines ignite, the thrust from the rocket unbalances those forces and the rocket travels upward.</p>
                 <p>Rocket works on the conservation of momentum. In a rocket, the fuel burns and produces gas at high temperature. These gases are ejected out of the rocket from a nozzle at the back side of the rocket. The ejecting gas exerts a forward force on the rocket which help in accelerating. Through the mass of gases escaping per second is very small and their momentum is very large due to their tremendous velocity of escape. An equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket which despite its large mass builds up a high velocity.</p>
